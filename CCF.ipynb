    "- 1- Loan Guarantee: With a notional amount of $1,000,000 and a CCF of 50%, the credit equivalent amount is $500,000. This means the bank considers half of the guarantee amount as potential on-balance sheet exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2- Standby Letter of Credit: For a $500,000 commitment with a 20% CCF, the credit equivalent amount is $100,000. This lower CCF reflects a lower risk of this item converting to an on-balance sheet exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3- Unused Credit Line: Despite having the lowest notional amount ($200,000), it has the highest CCF (75%), resulting in a credit equivalent amount of $150,000. This high CCF suggests a significant likelihood of this credit line being used in case of default.\n",
