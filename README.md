Risk models in banking are essential tools used to assess, quantify, and manage various types of financial risks. These models help institutions make informed decisions regarding lending, investment,
and regulatory compliance. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key risk models commonly employed in the banking sector:

## Credit Risk Models
Credit risk models evaluate the likelihood that a borrower will default on their obligations. These models are crucial for determining the creditworthiness of individual borrowers or corporate entities. Key components include:
- Probability of Default (PD): Estimates the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their debt obligations.
- Loss Given Default (LGD): Measures the potential loss a lender could incur if a borrower defaults, expressed as a percentage of total exposure.
- Exposure at Default (EAD): Assesses the total amount exposed to loss at the time of default, which helps in understanding potential losses under different scenarios

## The Mathematics required to understand risk models involves mastering several key techniques and tools:
- Probability Theory: Used to model uncertainties and quantify risks, particularly in credit and market risk assessments.
- Stochastic Modeling: Utilized for simulating random processes and predicting future states of financial systems, often applied in asset pricing and risk management.
- Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES): Statistical measures used to estimate potential losses in portfolios over a specific time frame.
- Monte Carlo Simulation: Employed to evaluate the impact of risk by simulating a range of possible outcomes based on random variables.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Increasingly used for analyzing large datasets to predict and manage financial risks
